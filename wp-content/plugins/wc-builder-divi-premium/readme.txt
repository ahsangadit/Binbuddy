Build amazing WooCommerce pages using Divi builder.

== Description ==
WooCommerce Builder is the must-have plugin for any store owner who uses or want to use WooCommerce and Divi theme. With this plugin, you’ll be able to create stunning product layouts that will help you make more sales more than ever And starting from version 2.0, we have added the support for product categories and tags as well.

If you like me find the default design of WooCommerce pages to be boring, then this plugin is for you.
